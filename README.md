# Gamification of Education: SeekNSolve

## Project Overview
The **SeekNSolve** project is designed to make learning fun and engaging by introducing a genie who grants students three wishesâ€”each wish representing a subject to master. Upon selecting a subject, the student is transported into a world tailored to that subject, where they must complete a series of levels. Each level presents challenges and puzzles that help students learn concepts in a fun and interactive way. Upon completing all levels, the student is rewarded with the **final treasure**: knowledge.

### Key Features:
- **Genie as a Guide**: The genie introduces the player to the game and asks them to make three wishes, representing subjects they want to learn.
- **Subject-Based Worlds**: Each wish leads to a different world designed around the chosen subject. The available subjects are **Aptitude and Reasoning**, **Java**, and **SQL**.
- **Challenging Levels**: Each world contains multiple levels with subject-specific challenges and puzzles that the player must complete to progress.
- **Interactive Learning**: Concepts are taught through interactive gameplay mechanics, helping students absorb knowledge while enjoying the game.
- **Final Treasure**: After completing all the levels, students receive a final reward, symbolizing their mastery over the chosen subjects.

## How It Works:
1. **The Genie and the 3 Wishes**:
   - Upon starting the game, the player meets a mystical genie who offers to grant three wishes. Each wish corresponds to a subject the player wants to explore.
   - The player selects their subjects and is transported to the corresponding world.

2. **Explore the Worlds**:
   - Each world is uniquely designed to reflect the chosen subject. For example:
     - In the **Aptitude and Reasoning World**, players might solve puzzles involving logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and problem-solving skills.
     - In the **Java World**, players could complete coding challenges, manipulate data structures, and learn about object-oriented programming through interactive puzzles.
     - In the **SQL World**, players might query databases, solve relational database problems, and learn to manage data using SQL commands.

3. **Complete the Levels**:
   - Players must complete a series of levels, each focused on learning a different concept within the subject.
   - The levels are designed to be progressively harder, encouraging players to improve their understanding.

4. **Earn the Final Treasure**:
   - Once the player successfully completes all levels in the world, they unlock the **Final Treasure**â€”a symbol of the knowledge and mastery theyâ€™ve achieved.
